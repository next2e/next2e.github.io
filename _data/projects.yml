      came together to design, build, program, and decorate an arcade machine insummer/fall 2016.

      2E's build group. Their most recent project, Bar-enda, is designed and built
      to house two and a half shelves of liquids, as well as a 2ft cube minifridge
      (truly a staple piece of furniture for all your partying needs). Members are
      also involved in build projects like [Next Big
      Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtaZGuq195w) (big things in the
      courtyard) and [Next Haunt](http://haunt.mit.edu/) (an escape-the-room
      haunted house in the basement).

      Built by multiple 2 Easters, co-designed by Emmanuel Fasil and Brenda Stern.

      2E is lit, and as such, its lights must keep up with itself. Justin is
      building a wall to mount his LEDs for the enlightenment of the wing - and
      he's going to make 2 West pay for it! Just kidding, 2E welcomes outsiders.
      Come see the 2E light show! :)

      On those dark nights of the soul where you're staring down a pset due in 5
      hours, it's a comfort to get a message from 2E resident Los the Hammer
      (Carlos) that Losbucks is serving.

      Losbucks is currently a seed-stage stealth startup seeking full bean
      developers (pay in equity).
