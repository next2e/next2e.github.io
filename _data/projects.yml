        Looking for new music to listen to? Once a week, one 2E resident can
        share a YouTube or Spotify playlist with the songs that they regularly
        listen to, while other residents can discover new music this way!

        The 2E main lounge's primary amenity! The music box is used by
        residents occupying the main lounge to play music from YouTube for the

        the Main Lounge of when it's too loud during quiet hours.

        to house two and a half shelves of liquids, as well as a 2ft cube minifridge
        (truly a staple piece of furniture for all your partying needs). Members are
        also involved in build projects like [Next Big
        Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtaZGuq195w) (big things in the
        courtyard) and [Next Haunt](http://haunt.mit.edu/) (an escape-the-room
        haunted house in the basement).

        Built by multiple 2 Easters, co-designed by Emmanuel Fasil and Brenda Stern.

        he's going to make 2 West pay for it! Just kidding, 2E welcomes outsiders.

        On those dark nights of the soul where you're staring down a pset due in 5
        hours, it's a comfort to get a message from 2E resident Los the Hammer
        (Carlos) that Losbucks is serving.

        Losbucks is currently a seed-stage stealth startup seeking full bean
        developers (pay in equity).
